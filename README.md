# DeepLIFT_Cancer_TFs

This repository contains a multilayer perceptron model that classifies eight
cancer types based on the expression of transcription factors (TFs) and subsequently 
inteprets the model using DeepLIFT to assign scores to each TF for each cancer. 
The scores are plotted in a chart versus the TFs and the top ten TFs for normal 
and cancerous tissue are printed.
